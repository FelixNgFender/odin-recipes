      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 pound fatty ground pork</li>
      <li>½ pound uncooked medium shrimp - peeled, deveined, and chopped</li>
      <li>1 head Napa cabbage, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh chives, chopped</li>
      <li>3 stalks green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
        root
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix 1/2 cup cold water and cornstarch in a bowl until combined. Combine
        the filling: pork, shrimp, cabbage, chives, onions, ginger, garlic,
        cornstarch paste, wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper in a
        large bowl and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour and remaining water and knead the dough into a smooth ball.
        Use extra water/flour to get a slightly smooth and sticky ball. Let sit
        for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into little balls that roll out into
        4-inch diameter circles. You will have about 30 dough circles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 2 teaspoons of the filling onto the middle of each of the dough
        circles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap by folding the dough circles with filling in the middle in half and
        pinching the edges to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently add about 10
        dumplings into the boiling water. Bring the water back to a boil and add
        1/2 cup more cold water. Repeat this twice before taking the dumplings
        out to serve; the pork filling should no longer be pink and shrimp
        should be firm. Repeat the boiling and adding of cold water with each
        batch of dumplings. Adding the cold water between boils reduces the
        starch buildup in the water.
